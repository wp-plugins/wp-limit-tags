WP Limit Tags allows you to set a maximum number of tags for posts.

== Description ==

The plugin provides a settings screen where you can set the maximum number of tags which are allowed to be assigned to posts. It also allows you to choose which post types have restricted tag assignment. It works for all taxonomies that are non-hierarchical.

On the post edit screen, for those posts activated, you will not be allowed to add more than allowed number of tags.
